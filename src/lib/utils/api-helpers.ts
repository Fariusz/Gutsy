 * This file contained generic API handlers that were causing response formatting issues.

 * This file is kept for reference but the exports are no longer used.
 * All API endpoints now use direct async function implementations for better control
 * over response formatting and error handling.

// File intentionally left mostly empty - generic handlers were problematic
